== TermBot

An OS X utility that displays big pulsing text every time you type a word you haven't typed before.

Limitations:
* Text editing is a complex process; there's no way we can accurately determine all words correctly.

== Troubleshooting: Access for Assistive Devices

Make sure to enable "Access for Assistive Devices" in your system preferences, otherwise we
won't be able to access information about other applications.

In OS X 10.9 Mavericks:
* System Settings > Security & Privacy > Privacy Tab > Accessibility
* Allow access for TermBot
* Restart the TermBot application
